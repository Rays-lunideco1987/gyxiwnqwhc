Omg, Flight Risk... just whoosh, like a damn catapult... My brain still spinning like it's trapped in a gyroscope. The theater was buzzing, people loud like a messed-up beehive. Popcorn everywhere, I'm literally sitting on crumb islands. Some guy's cologne—enough to drown in. But that scene where the plane dipped and swooped, wowza! Like that time in spin class when resistance just cranked up without warning, thigh muscles screaming... Oh! Someone said I should 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the  , probably cause 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘨 it in peace sounds like actual heaven.

And the way they twisted that plot... like a yoga pose gone wrong, totally unexpected tangle. My back hurts from sitting, I should stretch more. Random thought:  s are like marathons, but with your eyes instead of legs. My phone's almost dead, and I've got greasy popcorn fingers on the screen, ugh. That dogfight in the clouds? Reminded me of chasing squirrels—impossible! Wait, I think I promised to 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the   again next Friday, no idea how I'll manage another round in those seats...
